            <p class="card-text">
                Mapshare is a web application that allows you to easily share and find locations using a revolutionary system called Mapcodes.
                My goal is to make location sharing easier and accessible to everyone.

            <h2 class="card-title">What are Mapcodes?</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                Mapcodes are short, easy-to-remember codes that represent specific locations on Earth.
                Think of them as a more user-friendly version of latitude and longitude coordinates.
                Some key features of mapcodes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Typically 4-7 characters long</li>
                <li>They can represent any location on Earth with high precision (around 5m²)</li>
                <li>Easy to read, say, and remember (think of it like a UK postcode but for the whole world)</li>
                <li>They Work internationally and are language-independent. Mapcodes are the same no matter where it is in the world!</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-text">
                For example, instead of saying "51.5007° N, 0.1246° W" for Big Ben in London, you could just use the Mapcode "JJ.66".
                Isn't that a lot easier?
            </p>
            <h3>Territories and Mapcodes</h3>
            <p class="card-text">
                Mapcodes can be used with or without territory codes.
                When a territory code is used, it allows for shorter mapcodes within that specific region.
                For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The international mapcode for Big Ben is "GCPVJ.QGQV"</li>
                <li>But within the GBR territory, it can simply be "JJ.66"</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-text">
                This system allows for easier local use, but be careful when sharing across different territories!
                Mapshare automatically provides the most relevant mapcode based on the location, but also offers alternative options when available.

            <h2 class="card-title">Why Use Mapshare?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Mapcodes are much easier to communicate than long GPS coordinates.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Pinpoint specific locations, even in areas without formal addressing systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Universal:</strong> Works anywhere in the world, making it great for international use.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Mapcodes don't contain any inherent information about the location, enhancing privacy.</li>
